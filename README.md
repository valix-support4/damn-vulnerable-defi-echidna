# Damn-vulnerable-defi - Echidna edition

This repo is meant to be used with exercises 5 and 6 of [Building-secure-contracts/Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/program-analysis/echidna).

Only two challenges are currently supported (naive receiver, and unstoppable).
The changes made to the original repo:
- Remove the `dependencyCompiler` section in `hardhat.config.js`
- Add two Echidna config files (`unstoppable.yaml`, `naivereceiver.yaml`)
- Add two templates (consider doing the exercises without looking at the templates first):
  - [contracts/unstoppable/UnstoppableEchidna.sol](contracts/unstoppable/UnstoppableEchidna.sol)
  - [contracts/naive-receiver/NaiveReceiverEchidna.sol](contracts/naive-receiver/NaiveReceiverEchidna.sol)
- Enable transfers of tokens in `contracts/the-rewarder/AccountingToken.sol` (the original mock token does not allow transfers, limiting the fuzzer exploration)

Below is the original readme
